Here’s a **100-word `README.md`** for your SafePath project:

```markdown
# SafePath – Real-Time Tourist Safety & Guidance Platform  

SafePath is a real-time safety and guidance platform designed for tourists exploring unfamiliar regions. It provides live risk mapping, AI-powered safety suggestions, emergency alerts, and multilingual communication support. Tourists can view attractions, safe/risk zones, and send SOS alerts, while responders manage incidents and advisories. Admins control places, zones, and reports for system reliability.  

Built with **Ballerina microservices**, **PostgreSQL**, **React.js**, and **Asgardeo authentication**, SafePath integrates APIs, WebSockets, and cloud storage to ensure secure, scalable, and interactive experiences. This project enhances travel safety by combining live data, AI, and communication tools into one unified platform.
